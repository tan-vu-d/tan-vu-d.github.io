<h1>Elsa Schiaparelli 1938 Skeleton Dress</h1>

To her contemporaries, this evening dress was outrageous-- almost an offensive force against the time's idea of beauty. 

In collaboration with Dali Salvador, Schia modified an otherwise elegant, formal dress by using a sinister black silk crepe as the main material and added representations of human bones throughout the garment. The dress was a perfect example of Schia's creativity and rebelliousness.

It also proves itself to be influential. Almost 60-70 years later, we can still see the dress's presence in the work of Alexander McQueen, Iris van Herpen. In 2019, Daniel Roseberry also reinterpreted the dress in his haute couture collection for Maison Schiaparelli.
