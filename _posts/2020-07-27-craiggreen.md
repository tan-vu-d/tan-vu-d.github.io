<h>Craig Green F/W 2013</h>
Because of its recency, Craig Green's Fall/Winter 2013 collection is just yet to be considered "history"; however, as time goes on, it is destined to become part of fashion history for its creativity in concepts, material uses, and presentation.
<br>
Inspired by the idea of “shadows and reflections,” Green essentially divides the collection into two parts: "the body" and "the shadow." 
<br>
"The body" walks out of the runway first, with colors-- admittedly not vibrant, mostly milk, or navy.

<br>
Following each "body" is a "shadow" with all garments painted black and the model's exposed skin also painted this color.

The collection showcased a wide range of fabrics and materials, such as patchwork cotton knits, calico, felt, crinkled suede, and wood. The silhouettes were work-wear inspired. Most, if not all, were easy to incorporate into everyday wear. Each look was layered in a simple yet attractive and loveable way with cropped, rolled-up trousers and oversized tops. Besides the clothes, Craig Green also displays his sculptural background through the use of wood shards as structured headpieces. 
<br>
Even though the collection is critically well-received, some laymen's comments on the show-- mostly directed at the headpieces-- were quite funny. For examples:
<br>
"WTF IS THIS SHIT , GARBAGE BAGS AND FUCKING WOOD PLANKS ON N[word] FACES AND SHIT"
<br>
"Yo who coppin da new wood plank face mask. Fire. WTF"
<br>
"I really hope i see rappers wearin fences on there face soon" "bwhahhahahaha"
