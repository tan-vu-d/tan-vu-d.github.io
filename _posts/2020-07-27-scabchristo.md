<h1>Undercover Spring 2003 “Scab” Visvim Christo</h1>

Undercover is originally a cult brand from Japan founded in 1993 by Jun Takahashi. 

Under the mentorship of Comme des Garcons's Rei Kawakubo, Jun and Undercover became famous in Japan. However, it was not until late 2002-- when Undercover's Spring 2003 Collection "Scab" was shown in Paris-- that the brand was globally recognized. 

An one-of-one item from this collection that has recently surfaced is a pair of Visvim Christo sandals.

Jun Takahashi reimagined Visvim’s classic and functional sandals by reconstructing it with individual patches stitched over each other to resemble human scabs. Detailed throughout the sandal are prints and hexagon studs along the side, plus black pointed studs adorning the straps.
